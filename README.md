## Introduction
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that pits two players against each other. Each player takes turns marking a square in a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a row‚Äîhorizontally, vertically, or diagonally‚Äîbefore the opponent does.

This project not only offers the traditional Player vs. Player mode but also introduces a challenging Player vs. Computer mode. The computer opponent utilizes the power of NumPy to make intelligent moves, providing an engaging and dynamic gaming experience.

## Key Features
- **Player vs. Player Mode:** Challenge a friend for a classic Tic-Tac-Toe showdown.
- **Player vs. Computer Mode:** Face off against a smart computer opponent with strategic moves.
- **Interactive GUI:** The game features a sleek and user-friendly graphical user interface created using the Turtle graphics library.
- **Smart Computer Moves:** The computer calculates optimal moves using NumPy, adding a layer of strategy to the game.

## Tech Stack
- Python üêç
- Turtle Graphics üê¢
- NumPy (for computer intelligence) üßÆ

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script (game.py).
2. Choose between a custom Player vs. Player game or challenge the computer.
3. Enjoy the interactive Turtle graphics interface.
4. Make your moves and experience the thrill of the game!
